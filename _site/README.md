# julianmarenz.github.io

Please see here the link to my personal webpage: [https://julianmarenz.github.io/](https://julianmarenz.github.io/). The theme of this website is based on the popular [Hyde] (https://github.com/poole/hyde) theme. For the purpose of my website, I have deleted a number of unnecessary components and added a few minor things. For more information on the theme and its usage please see the github repository linked above.
